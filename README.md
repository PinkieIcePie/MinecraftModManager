# MinecraftModManager

The purpose of this application is to streamline the Forge installation (Both client and Server) as well as make it easier for non-technical users to install mods for their version of minecraft, ultimately preventing forum posts of "My minecraft isn't working - Log Attached" etc. 

It's being developed as a personal project with the hopes of potentially becoming a fully-fledged minecraft launcher, at some point.
